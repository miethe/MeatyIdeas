## 0) Summary

Introduce consistent file icons and tag chips across file viewers to elevate scanning speed and contextual clarity. Emphasis on tight integration with design system, performant rendering in large trees, and seamless filter hooks.

## 1) Scope & Complexity

Complexity: Medium — primarily frontend with backend payload augmentation. Needs careful attention to performance, accessibility, and responsiveness.

## 2) Workstreams

1. **Design System & Assets** — icon library, tag chip guidelines, theming tokens.
2. **Backend Payload Updates** — expose tag + icon data in file APIs.
3. **Frontend Component Implementation** — icons, chips, overflow behaviours.
4. **Interactions & Analytics** — tag click filters, telemetry, accessibility.
5. **QA & Rollout** — regression, accessibility, staged release.

## 3) Milestones & Timeline

- **Week 1**: Design asset finalization, backend contract updates.
- **Week 2**: Build FE components, integrate with file tree/list, baseline performance tests.
- **Week 3**: Interaction polish, analytics, accessibility, documentation. Target GA behind flag end of week.

## 4) Design System & Assets (Week 1)

### 4.1 Icon Library
- **Task**: Audit required file types, create/adapt icon set with light/dark variants.
  - Acceptance: Asset list approved by design; tokens published to design system repo; linting assets for accessibility.
  - Dependencies: Design team.
  - Estimate: 2 points.

### 4.2 Tag Chip Tokens
- **Task**: Define spacing, typography, color tokens for chips and overflow indicator.
  - Acceptance: Documented spec, Figma updates, storybook entry for reference.
  - Dependencies: Icon library finalization.
  - Estimate: 1 point.

## 5) Backend Payload Updates (Week 1)

### 5.1 API Augmentation
- **Task**: Update file listing endpoints to return `tags[]` (id, label, color) and `icon_hint` (mime/extension).
  - Acceptance: Serializer changes with unit tests; contract doc updated; ensures no N+1 queries.
  - Dependencies: Tag normalization data source.
  - Estimate: 2 points.

### 5.2 Performance Safeguards
- **Task**: Measure payload growth, add caching or batching if necessary.
  - Acceptance: Response size < 50 KB for typical folder; metrics recorded; update monitoring.
  - Dependencies: Task 5.1.
  - Estimate: 1 point.

## 6) Frontend Components (Week 2)

### 6.1 `FileIcon` Component
- **Task**: Build icon renderer mapping extensions to design system icons.
  - Acceptance: Works in tree, list, search results; unit tests covering mapping, theme switching.
  - Dependencies: Icon library.
  - Estimate: 2 points.

### 6.2 `TagChip` Component
- **Task**: Create reusable chip with truncation, tooltip, overflow handling.
  - Acceptance: Supports max width, high contrast fallback, keyboard focus; storybook examples.
  - Dependencies: Tag tokens.
  - Estimate: 2 points.

### 6.3 Integrate into Views
- **Task**: Update file tree, list views, search results to render icon + chips.
  - Acceptance: Layout remains single-line desktop, wraps gracefully mobile; virtualization unaffected.
  - Dependencies: Components built.
  - Estimate: 3 points.

### 6.4 Responsive & Theming QA
- **Task**: Validate components across breakpoints and dark/light themes.
  - Acceptance: Visual regression tests added; manual QA sign-off.
  - Dependencies: Integration complete.
  - Estimate: 1 point.

## 7) Interactions & Analytics (Week 3)

### 7.1 Tag Click-to-Filter
- **Task**: Hook tag clicks into existing filter/search flows.
  - Acceptance: Emits analytics event, updates context state, shows toast confirmation; fallback tooltip if filtering unsupported.
  - Dependencies: Components integration.
  - Estimate: 2 points.

### 7.2 Accessibility Pass
- **Task**: Ensure aria labels, focus order, keyboard handling for icon/chip elements.
  - Acceptance: Screen reader announces "File: {name}, type: {type}, tags: {list}"; accessibility tests documented.
  - Dependencies: Interaction logic.
  - Estimate: 1 point.

### 7.3 Telemetry & Monitoring
- **Task**: Instrument `file_tag_impression`, `file_tag_clicked`, `file_icon_missing` events.
  - Acceptance: Analytics schema approved; dashboard stubbed for adoption metrics.
  - Dependencies: Tag click functionality.
  - Estimate: 1 point.

## 8) QA & Rollout

- **Task**: Regression tests across file-heavy projects (virtualized lists, nested folders).
  - Acceptance: QA sign-off; no critical perf regressions observed.
  - Dependencies: Week 2+3 deliverables.
  - Estimate: 1 point.

- **Task**: Documentation + release notes update highlighting new indicators.
  - Acceptance: Support articles updated, release comms ready.
  - Dependencies: Final UX approved.
  - Estimate: 1 point.

- **Task**: Feature flag rollout plan (`FILE_TAG_VISIBILITY`).
  - Acceptance: Toggle config, staged rollout schedule, monitoring plan documented.
  - Dependencies: QA sign-off.
  - Estimate: 1 point.

## 9) Risks & Mitigations

- **Visual clutter**: iterative design/testing, limit tags per row, provide overflow pattern.
- **Performance hits**: memoize components, lazy render off-screen nodes, monitor render time.
- **Incomplete data**: fallback UI states, monitoring for missing tag data, error logging.
- **Accessibility regressions**: involve accessibility partner early; run automated + manual audits.

## 10) Exit Criteria

- Icons and tags shipped behind flag with zero critical bugs.
- Performance benchmarks maintained (<16 ms row render budget) on staging dataset.
- Accessibility and analytics requirements met; documentation published.
- Decision log recorded for flag graduation and future enhancements.
