## 0) Summary

Launch a next-generation file management flow enabling folder-aware uploads, drag-and-drop ingestion, and in-app reorganization. Work spans backend upload services, real-time sync, and a unified frontend interaction model. Target velocity: 4-week sprint cadence with staged rollout behind `FILE_UPLOAD_V2` flag.

## 1) Scope & Complexity

Complexity: High — multi-surface UI, resumable uploads, concurrency, cross-client synchronization. Requires coordination with infra for storage limits and QA for cross-browser drag support.

## 2) Workstreams

1. **Upload Services & APIs** — endpoints, chunking, folder targeting, validation.
2. **Frontend Upload UX** — button flow, drag-and-drop interactions, progress UI.
3. **Reorganization Mechanics** — dragging existing files/folders, move API, optimistic updates.
4. **Real-time Sync & Telemetry** — websocket/pubsub integration, analytics, monitoring.
5. **QA, Accessibility, Rollout** — browser matrix, accessibility, docs, flag strategy.

## 3) Milestones & Timeline

- **Week 1**: Finalize API contracts, build upload service foundations, design QA review.
- **Week 2**: Implement frontend upload button + drag drop prototypes; integrate progress feedback.
- **Week 3**: Add reorganization drag, optimistic updates, error handling; begin telemetry wiring.
- **Week 4**: Cross-client sync, hardening, QA sweeps, documentation, rollout prep.

## 4) Upload Services & APIs (Week 1)

### 4.1 Chunked/Standard Upload Endpoint
- **Task**: Extend `/api/projects/{id}/files/upload` to accept `target_path`, chunk manifest, and metadata.
  - Acceptance: Supports multi-file payloads, ensures per-file transactions, returns upload IDs; integration tests for success/failure states.
  - Dependencies: Storage layer sign-off, antivirus pipeline.
  - Estimate: 5 points.

### 4.2 Folder Targeting & Validation
- **Task**: Normalize target paths, enforce permissions, and guard against invalid nesting.
  - Acceptance: Reject path traversal, confirm folder existence, gracefully create intermediate folders (if allowed).
  - Dependencies: Filesystem abstraction.
  - Estimate: 3 points.

### 4.3 Upload Progress Channel
- **Task**: Provide SSE/WebSocket messages for progress and completion.
  - Acceptance: Emits `upload_progress`, `upload_complete`, `upload_failed`; handles reconnect logic.
  - Dependencies: Real-time infrastructure.
  - Estimate: 3 points.

### 4.4 Size & Duplicate Handling
- **Task**: Enforce size limits; implement duplicate resolution choices (replace/keep-both) at API level.
  - Acceptance: API accepts `collision_strategy`, updates metadata accordingly; unit tests cover each path.
  - Dependencies: Task 4.1.
  - Estimate: 2 points.

## 5) Frontend Upload UX (Week 2)

### 5.1 Upload Button Experience
- **Task**: Create `UploadMenu` component with file/folder upload options and folder picker.
  - Acceptance: Works in modal + full view, adapts to responsive layouts, integrates with permission state.
  - Dependencies: API ready, design tokens.
  - Estimate: 3 points.

- **Task**: Staging queue UI.
  - Acceptance: Displays pending uploads with progress, allows cancel/retry; uses shared state store.
  - Dependencies: Progress channel.
  - Estimate: 2 points.

### 5.2 Drag-and-Drop Upload
- **Task**: Implement global drop zone highlighting current folder.
  - Acceptance: Detects drag enter/leave, highlights tree nodes, auto-expands on hover delay.
  - Dependencies: Drag utilities shared with tree component.
  - Estimate: 3 points.

- **Task**: Tree node drop target support.
  - Acceptance: Accepts file drop, sets target path accordingly, handles nested expansions.
  - Dependencies: Task 5.2.
  - Estimate: 2 points.

## 6) Reorganization Mechanics (Week 3)

### 6.1 Move API
- **Task**: Expose `/api/projects/{id}/files/move` supporting batch moves with conflict detection.
  - Acceptance: Prevents cyclical moves, returns updated metadata; integration + unit tests.
  - Dependencies: Existing file model.
  - Estimate: 3 points.

### 6.2 Frontend Drag for Existing Items
- **Task**: Add draggable handles to rows/tree nodes; implement drop feedback and optimistic update.
  - Acceptance: Moves update immediately, rollback on failure; accessible alternative (`Move to…` dialog) accessible via context menu.
  - Dependencies: Move API.
  - Estimate: 4 points.

### 6.3 Duplicate & Error UX
- **Task**: Collision modal allowing Replace/Keep Both/Cancel.
  - Acceptance: Works for uploads and moves; handles rename logic (`filename (1).ext`).
  - Dependencies: Move + upload flows.
  - Estimate: 2 points.

## 7) Real-time Sync & Telemetry (Week 3-4)

### 7.1 Client Sync
- **Task**: Subscribe to `file_events` channel; update trees when other users upload/move files.
  - Acceptance: Minimizes flicker, dedupes events, handles offline fallback.
  - Dependencies: Progress channel infrastructure.
  - Estimate: 2 points.

### 7.2 Analytics
- **Task**: Emit analytics for upload/move lifecycle.
  - Acceptance: Events include duration, size bucket, target path; unit tests verifying payload.
  - Dependencies: Frontend flows.
  - Estimate: 1 point.

### 7.3 Monitoring Dashboards
- **Task**: Create Grafana/LK dashboards for error rate, throughput, latency.
  - Acceptance: Alerts configured for failure >5%, backlog >50 items; documented runbook.
  - Dependencies: Telemetry events.
  - Estimate: 1 point.

## 8) QA, Accessibility, Rollout (Week 4)

- **Task**: Cross-browser drag QA matrix (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox).
  - Acceptance: Checklist signed off; bugs triaged.
  - Dependencies: Feature complete frontend.
  - Estimate: 2 points.

- **Task**: Accessibility audit (keyboard, screen reader, contrast of drop zones).
  - Acceptance: No blocker issues; remediation documented.
  - Dependencies: UI stabilized.
  - Estimate: 1 point.

- **Task**: Rollout readiness (flag config, docs, release notes).
  - Acceptance: Support docs updated, release comms drafted, flag strategy approved.
  - Dependencies: All prior workstreams.
  - Estimate: 1 point.

## 9) Risk Log & Mitigations

- **Upload spikes**: coordinate with infra to throttle per-user concurrency; monitor storage usage.
- **Drag-n-drop regressions**: gated flag, fallback to upload button, thorough QA.
- **Optimistic UI conflicts**: implement queue for moves with reconciliation on server response.
- **Accessibility gaps**: pair with design/UX to provide keyboard & screen reader alternatives.

## 10) Exit Criteria

- Manual QA and automated tests green in CI with new scenarios.
- Performance validated (median upload complete ≤4 s for ≤25 MB).
- Telemetry dashboards live; on-call runbook updated.
- `FILE_UPLOAD_V2` ready for staged rollout with stakeholder sign-off.
