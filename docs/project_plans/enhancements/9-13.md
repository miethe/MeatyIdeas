## Enhancement Requests

### Sidebar

* The sidebar should be organized into distinct sections for easier navigation. Each should consist of an expandable section that can be collapsed or expanded by the user. When expanded, it should show all top-level contents from that section.
* The following Sections should be implemented:
  * Projects
  * Tags
  * Filters
* Projects should show all projects the user has access to. Each Project should be both clickable, to navigate to that Project page, as well as expandable, showing all top-level files within that Project.
* Tags should show all tags the user has access to. Each Tag should be clickable, displaying a full-screen modal with a list of all files associated with that Tag.
* Filters should allow the user to narrow down the file list by various criteria, such as file type, date modified, and other relevant attributes.

### Other

* There should be a full-screen modal which Search, Tags, and Filters each can utilize (or that are structured the same for each) to show results.

### Top Navigation Bar

* There should be a User Profile section on the far right side of the navigation bar. Clicking it should open a dropdown menu with options for viewing and editing the user profile, as well as logging out.

### Git Integration

* The application should integrate with Git to allow users to view and manage their Git repositories directly within the app.
* Users should be able to clone, pull, and push changes to their repositories from within the app.
* A visual representation of the Git repository structure (e.g., branches, commits) should be available to users.
* Users should be able to connect to multiple git repos, with 1 per Project if desired, or alternatively shared across multiple/all Projects.

### Projects

* Every Project should have a unique name and identifier. The 'slug' generation should manage non-unique conflicts by appending a portion of the UUID.
* A user should be able to simply edit the name, description, and all other details of a Project after creation.
* When adding a new tag to a file or Project from any screen, all existing user tags should show as available to choose from, filtering as the user types, or allowing a new one to be created inline.
* Whenever adding, editing, renaming, etc any files, the UI should update immediately to reflect those changes, without the user needing to refresh.
* The Projects page should cleanly support directories, allowing users to create, rename, and delete directories as needed. The Files viewer should also support navigating into directories to view their contents, expanding/collapsing directories, etc. Each directory should have a forward slash '/' at the end of its name to indicate that it is a directory. It should be very clear and intuitive for users to manage their files and folders.
* The Projects page should support drag-and-drop functionality for moving files and directories. Users should be able to select one or multiple files/directories and drag them to a different location within the same Project or to another Project.
* Users should be able to import a Project, either as a zip file of the entire Project directory or as individual files, as a remote or local git repo, or as a JSON file structured specifically for MeatyIdeas Projects. The export function should support all the same formats.
* Every file should have a copy icon on the file 'Card' in the Project view which copies the full raw text of the file to the clipboard.
* Every file should have a download icon on the file 'Card' in the Project view which downloads the file in its original format.

### Dashboard

* Projects should be able to be organized into different categories or views for better management and accessibility. Users should be able to drag and drop them into groups, or click the '...' menu to move the Project. There should be an easy way to create new categories, groups, tags, etc.
* Users should be able to share a Project simply via an option in the '...' menu. This should generate a shareable link that can be copied to the clipboard.
