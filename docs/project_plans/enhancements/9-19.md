## Fixes

The tags, filters, and search functionalities do not appear to currently be operational in the app. Whenever trying to search or filter, no results are returned for any patterns.

When clicking a tab in the filter bar, the displayed projects should automatically update to only display Projects with that Tag. The same goes for any other Filters. 

## Requests

The main dashboard should have 2 views, a Project view and a File view. If a user has clicked a Tag to filter results, the Projects view should show only Projects that match that tag. If a Project has files which match that filter, it should be shown but greyed out. Clicking on a Project should show all Files in that Project in a Modal view of the Project. The Modal should also have an and the Files tab should show Files that match. When no filter is applied, the Files tab should show all Files within a selected Project.

Only Search should utilize the Modal. Search should allow searching by any parameter of a Project or File. It should return both Projects and Files, with each in a separate section of the Modal.
